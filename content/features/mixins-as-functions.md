## Using Mixins as Functions

All variables defined in a mixin are visible and can be used in caller's scope (unless the caller defines its own variable with the same name). 

Example:
```less
.mixin() {
  @width:  100%;
  @height: 200px;
}

.caller {
  .mixin();
  width:  @width;
  height: @height;
}

```
Output:
```css
.caller {
  width:  100%;
  height: 200px;
}
```

Thus variables defined in a mixin can act as its return values. This allows us to create a mixin that can be used almost like a function.

Example:
```less
.average(@x, @y) {
  @average: ((@x + @y) / 2);
}

div {
  .average(16px, 50px); // "call" the mixin
  padding: @average;    // use its "return" value
}

```
Output:
```css
div {
  padding: 33px;
}
```
